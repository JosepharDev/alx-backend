## [0x01. Caching](0x01-caching)
The project involves learning about caching - storing frequently requested data in a temporary storage location, so that subsequent requests for the same data can be served more quickly and efficiently.

### :wrench: Project setup.
```bash
# Create project directory and readme.
mkdir ./0x01-caching/
touch ./0x01-caching/README.md
cd 0x01-caching
```
